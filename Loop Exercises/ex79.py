Exercise 79: Maximum Integer
This exercise examines the process of identifying the maximum value in a collection
of integers. Each of the integers will be randomly selected from the numbers between
1 and 100. The collection of integers may contain duplicate values, and some of the
integers between 1 and 100 may not be present.
Take a moment and think about how you would handle this problem on paper.
Many people would check each integer in sequence and ask themself if the number
that they are currently considering is larger than the largest number that they have seen
previously. If it is, then they forget the previous maximum number and remember
the current number as the new maximum number. This is a reasonable approach,
and will result in the correct answer when the process is performed carefully. If you
were performing this task, how many times would you expect to need to update the
maximum value and remember a new number?
While we can answer the question posed at the end of the previous paragraph using
probability theory, we are going to explore it by simulating the situation. Create a
program that begins by selecting a random integer between 1 and 100. Save this
integer as the maximum number encountered so far. After the initial integer has been
selected, generate 99 additional random integers between 1 and 100. Check each
integer as it is generated to see if it is larger than the maximum number encountered
so far. If it is then your program should update the maximum number encountered
and count the fact that you performed an update. Display each integer after you
generate it. Include a notation with those integers which represent a new maximum.
After you have displayed 100 integers your program should display the maximum value encountered, along with the number of times the maximum value
was updated during the process. Partial output for the program is shown below,
withâ€¦ representing the remaining integers that your program will display. Run your
program several times. Is the number of updates performed on the maximum value
what you expected?

from random import randrange

num = 100
max_num = randrange(1, num + 1)
print(max_num)

updates = 0

for i in range(1, num):
    current = randrange(1, num + 1)
    if current > max_num:
        max_num = current
        updates += 1
        print('{}   <= Update'. format(current))
    else:
        print(current)

print('The maximum number found was', max_num)
print('The maximum number was updated {} times'. format(updates))
