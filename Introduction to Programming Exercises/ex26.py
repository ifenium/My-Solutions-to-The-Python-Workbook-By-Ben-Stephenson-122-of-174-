Exercise 26: Current Time
Python includes a library of functions for working with time, including a function
called asctime in the time module. It reads the current time from the computerâ€™s internal clock and returns it in a human-readable format. Write a program
that displays the current time and date. Your program will not require any input from
the user.

from time import asctime
print(asctime())
