Exercise 28: Wind Chill
When the wind blows in cold weather, the air feels even colder than it actually is because the 
movement of the air increases the rate of cooling for warm objects, like people. 
This effect is known as wind chill.In 2001, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States adopted the
following formula for computing the wind chill index. Within the formula Ta is the
air temperature in degrees Celsius and V is the wind speed in kilometers per hour.
A similar formula with different constant values can be used with temperatures in
degrees Fahrenheit and wind speeds in miles per hour.
WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215Ta âˆ’ 11.37V 0.16 + 0.3965TaV 0.16
Write a program that begins by reading the air temperature and wind speed from the
user. Once these values have been read your program should display the wind chill
index rounded to the closest integer.

print('The wind chill index is only considered valid for temperatures less than or\
equal to 10 degrees Celsius and wind speeds exceeding 4.8 kilometers per hour')

ta = float(input('Enter the current temperature in Celsius: '))
v = float(input('Enter the windspeed in Kilometers per hour(Km/H): '))

wci = 13.12 + 0.6215 * ta - 11.37 * v**0.16 + 0.3965 * ta * v**0.16

print('The Current wind chill index is {}'. format(wci))
