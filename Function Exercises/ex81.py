Exercise 81: Compute the Hypotenuse
Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as
its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean
theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of
the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the
length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.

    opposite = float(input('Enter the opposite side of the Right angled triangle: '))

    print('The Hypotenuse(longest side) of the right angled triangle is: {:.2f}'. format(hypotenuse(adjacent,opposite)))
